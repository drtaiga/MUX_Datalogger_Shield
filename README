This repository contains all of the information required to produce 
multiplexer-datalogger shield for the Arduino Uno. The shield features two
sets of heavy duty screw terminals for coupling sensors to the Arduino.
It is assumed that each sensor has three leads: one for power (3.3V), one for
a ground connection, and one for a return signal (0-3.3V). The shield also
has a 4051 8x1 multiplexer for switching between the eight analog inputs, and
it accomodates an SD card for data storage.
